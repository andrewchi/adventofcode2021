# adventofcode2021

Andrew Chi's solutions to the Advent of Code 2021 puzzles, written in python3.

There are two external packages that need to be installed in the Python virtual environment.
```
pip install numpy
pip install igraph
```
Run the code as follows:
```
$ cd 2021-12-01
$ python3 count_increases.py < day1input.txt
```
There are usually two different Python scripts for part 1 and part 2.  For example:
* Day 1 part 1: `count_increases.py`
* Day 1 part 2: `count_w3_increases.py`

The naming is puzzle-specific.

## Unfinished puzzles

I haven't solved puzzles 19, 23, and 24, so those subdirectories have the puzzle statement only.
